<p2>When planning to build a website there is a few things you must keep in
mind. You must be able to sustain a clean cut webpage that is simple and
appealing. The website should be fast and easy to navigate. lastly you should
keep in mind who your target audience is.</p2>
<hr>
<p2>There are different styles or formats to choose from when creating a
website. These choices include a linear website, which means the website is
arranged in a specific pattern from one page to the next. Another format is
called a hierarchical website, this is when the website is arranged in almost a
structure. Finally the last format is called a webbed website, this is when
every page connects to one another</p2>
