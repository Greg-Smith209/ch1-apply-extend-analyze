      <p>Chapter 1, Extend your knowledge</p>

<p>In section 1.1 of w3.org, the main topic of discussion is different ways to
   <br>
present information for a non text situation.</p>


<p>Within section 1.2 the focus is time based media. This can be applied to <br>
pre recorded audio and video, it can be used for captions that synchronize with <br>
live audio. Other examples include sign language, or even live audio.</p>


<p>In my own opinion 1.3 was a little more interesting than the last two.<br>
The topic of 1.3 is adaptable content the is able to change and be presented <br>
in different way without losing data or is structure.</p>


<p>Finally in section 1.4 the topic is making creating information that stands <br>
out from other content and the background. A few ways someone can do <br>
this using audio, use different text sizes, and maybe even using contrast.</p>
